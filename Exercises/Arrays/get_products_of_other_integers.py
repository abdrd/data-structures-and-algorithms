"""
You have a list of integers, and for each index you want to find the product of every integer except the 
integer at that index.

For example, given:

  [1, 7, 3, 4]

Python 2.7
your function would return:

  [84, 12, 28, 21]

Python 2.7
by calculating:

  [7 * 3 * 4,  1 * 3 * 4,  1 * 7 * 4,  1 * 7 * 3]
