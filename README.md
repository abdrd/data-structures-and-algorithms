# Data structures

#### I am adding new data structure implementations every time I learn a new data structure.

I try to implement the methods/algorithms *before* watching any tutorial. This way, I think I am going to get better at programming quickly :)
Since I am not studying in a branch related to computer science, I don't really have a solid computer science knowledge. (I am not very knowledgable about the fundamentals of 
computer science)  But I am learning new things everyday. (I started coding 9 months ago). 

#### This is the aim of the repo: help me be kept motivated to learn data structures.

I am currently implementing data structures in *Python*, but I plan to add at least 2 other languages: Typescript and Go. Despite the fact that this might seem unnecessary;
I think, it will help people who are comfortable with practising data structures in Typescript or Go.

I am open to feedback / modifications / fixes / improvements to the code; I would like to know how I can improve my algorithm skills/code.

Have a great day!
