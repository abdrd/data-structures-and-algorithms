# Data structures and Algorithms

#### I am adding new data structure implementations every time I learn a new data structure.

I try to implement the methods/algorithms _before_ watching any tutorial. This way, I think I am going to get better at programming quickly :)

#### This repo is helping me stay motivated to learn data structures (and algorithms).

I am open to feedback / modifications / fixes / improvements to the code; I would like to know how I can improve my algorithm skills / code.

Have a great day!
